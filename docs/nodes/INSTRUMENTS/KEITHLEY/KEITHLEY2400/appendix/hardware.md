To record an IV curve from an electric device (LED, Solar cells, etc.) with Flojoy, you'll need a setup with the following:


- A Keithley 2400 source meter to send voltages and record currents from the electronic device.
- A source of light that you'll use as a fake sun for calibrating the output of your solar cells. (You can also use the real sun by experimenting outside)
- A computer connected to the Keithley 2400 with a serial communication cable.
