# NumPy and SciPy

NumPy and SciPy (NUMerical PYthon and SCIentific PYthon) are among the most downloaded Python packages.
They each have multiple functions that can prove useful to Flojoy users. To this end, many NumPy and
SciPy functions have been autogenerated in node format for use in Flojoy. Currently the functions are 
limited to NumPy's linear algebra (numpy.linalg) and SciPy's signal and stats (scipy.signal, scipy.stats) functions

For more informortion see: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/).

:::caution
Many of these nodes are experimental. If you need help with a specific node please contact us.

## Example

The below example uses the scipy function [Savgol Filter](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html) which can be used to smooth nodes. To show this usage a noisy sine plot is generated. The Savgol filter is then applied to approximate the original sine function.

<details><summary>For Developers</summary>
<p>

These nodes are autogenerated using [module_scraper.py](https://github.com/flojoy-io/python/blob/main/flojoy/module_scraper.py) in the Flojoy Python library. The script should be ran directly in the nodes directory. 

Functions can have various issues that prevent being autogenerated. For example if parameter/argument types are not valid in Flojoy:

```
FORBIDDEN_TYPES = [
"tuple",
"array-like",
"array_like",
"function",
"callable",
"sequence",
"... array_like",
"number or ndarray or sequence",
"complex"
]
```

Numpy arguements can also be specified in non-standard ways such as: ```non-zero int``` (or when multiple types are specified as above) which Flojoy cannot currently handle. It may be possible to include these functions automatically or with slight manual changes to the autogenerated script.

Currently these nodes only handle ordered pair data. It is likely that some nodes will need matrix dtypes.
